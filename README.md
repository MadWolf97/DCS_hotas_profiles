# DCS_hotas_profiles
The main idea of this repository is to save the button settings of my virpil devices, as well as the button assignation for a series of airplanes in DCS

If you want to try them out for yourshelf be my guest, its still a work in progress and will be upsated while I try new aircrafts.

The controlls that will be assinged are the esential buttons to controll the aircraft during fligth, and to engage propperly in combat.
